# Brief description of the datasets I will use for this project

The dataset I will use for this project is from Ryan Mills' Lab. There are 3 main parts:
 
1. The single-cell bams split from a bulk 10X chromium single-cell RNA-seq bam file (20 cells were random selected, data is available here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ke5s2w7gb96m09g/AACM1vP24MTBQDFTNwUgjlWJa?dl=0)

2. The corrsponding bam index file (data is available here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ke5s2w7gb96m09g/AACM1vP24MTBQDFTNwUgjlWJa?dl=0) 

3. The corresponding barcode list file
